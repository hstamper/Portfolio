                    I was born and raised in Jacksonville, FL. Raised by a single mother who retired from the education industry as a school teacher for over 25 years. My mother instilled in me multiple quality traits such as Honesty, Commitment, Hard Work, Discipline, and Integrity. Growing up as a kid I really didn’t fully understand the lessons she taught me until I reached adulthood. Now I can truly be thankful because these traits are what I strive to live by on a daily basis.

                    Im a very kind and fun loving person who loves sports such as Basketball, Football, Soccer, and Baseball. I think the most interesting and most vital dynamic in sports is Teamwork. Without everyones contribution and commitment on a team, there would be no success.

                    My career background includes Real Estate, Banking, and Software Development. Throughout my career I’ve obtained a vast knowledge in each industry. Although I’ve been able to learn a lot , Im still in pursuit of learning a lot more.
